# EthOn Glossary
This glossary is compiled from the _rdfs:comment_ annotations of the EthOn ontology.
Please also consider looking at the [specification of EthOn](http://ethon.consensys.net/EthOn_spec.html).
It is more detailed and includes class/property hierarchy information and restrictions.
## A
### Account
[`ethon:Account`](http://ethon.consensys.net/Account)   
Accounts are identified by their address. They have an intrinsic ethereum balance and a transaction count (accountNonce) maintained as part of the Ethereum state. Contract Accounts also have (possibly empty) EVM Code and a (possibly empty) Storage State associated with them.
### Account State
[`ethon:AccountState`](http://ethon.consensys.net/AccountState)   
State of an Ethereum Account. It is comprised on four pieces of information: nonce, balance, storage root and code hash. The data is stored in a Merkle Patricia tree as a mapping between addresses and Account states. The Account State is part of the World State, as it resembles the state of exactly one Account.

A scalar value equal to the number of Wei owned by an Account at a given Account state.
### Account balance prefunded

The amount of Wei an Account was prefunded with in a Protocol Variant. In the case that an Account receives multiple prefunds in multiple Protocol Variants, the amounts are summed. In contrast to the regular Account balance it is a property of the Account itself and not of its state.

A Block is chained to its preceeding Block by a cryptographic hash as a means of reference. Blocks contain an identifier for the final state after all transactions contained in it are validated. There is an incentive mechanism that provides incentives to generate new Blocks ("mine Blocks") that comply to the rules of Ethereum by issuing a reward to an Account specified by the miner.

Merkle Patricia trees provide a cryptographically authenticated data structure that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings, although for the scope of this paper we are restricting keys and values to strings (to remove this restriction, just use any serialization format for other data types). They are fully deterministic, meaning that a Patricia tree with the same (key,value) bindings is guaranteed to be exactly the same down to the last byte and therefore have the same root hash, provide the holy grail of O(log(n)) efficiency for inserts, lookups and deletes, and are much easier to understand and code than more complex comparison-based alternatives like red-black trees.
